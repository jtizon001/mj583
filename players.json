pro contract.\u00a0 She was one of the stars of our spring game against the pro team in 2016.\u00a0 In fact, right afterwards the Sky Blue coach walked up to me asked me who\u2019s the left back and I said Maya Worth.\u00a0 And the next question was when does she graduate.\u00a0 There are a thousand different reasons we play the pro teams for the experience our players get to be under the gun

She\u2019s very fast.\u00a0 She\u2019s very tough.\u00a0 She\u2019s very combative so she could start up front for us, she could start in the midfield for us, she could start in the back for us and I am very excited for her potential when she returns next year.\u00a0 Her athletic platform is very good but so is her technical platform.\u00a0 But the thing that excites me most is that the girl competes.\u00a0 The biggest adjustment for most freshmen to make is that they don\u2019t understand the level.\u00a0 Last year she showed the ability to compete immediately.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s

last year\u2019s lacrosse season and will red-shirt this year, but I look forward to her return for her final soccer season in 2018.\u00a0 Obviously bouncing back and forth between the two programs is
